<p>When Trevor Noah was born the institutionalized racial segregation was already in South Africa. It was illegal for black and white people to have a child. Since Trevor’s father was a white Swiss and his mother being a black Xhosa, them having a child was a crime. He goes ahead to tell us of the struggles he faced during that era. He tells us what he experienced being a biracial child since he was born illegally.</p>
<p>He was forced to stay indoors by his family especially when he was young. Since he spent most of his time indoors he was unable to interact with other people in the society. He only talked with his family members during this time. For example when he was playing with his cousins, where he (Trevor) was a doctor and his two cousins Bulelwa and Mlungisi,were his patients .While he was operating on Bulelwa’s ear with a set of matches ,he accidentally pierced her eardrum. All hell broke loose as his grandmother came running towards the kitchen. “What’s happening?!”Then her grandmother patched up Bulelwa’s ear to stop the bleeding. After finishing with Bulelwa’s ear she whipped out a belt which she used to beat the shit out of Bulelwa. Then she also beats the shit out of Mlungisi but Trevor wasn’t beaten pg. (51).Even though he is the one who caused the accident showing some form of racism.</p>
<p>But we see this whenever he gets into trouble he was the only kid who was never punished. And this somehow made not to be able to know what punishment looked like unless it was his mother who never joked when it came to punishing him. This I think made him suffer a lot as a child since his childhood life wasn’t like that of other children and he was not able to know people due to his color. </p>

<p>When he becomes an adolescent is when he realizes how hard life is when you are a child of mixed race he is not accepted with some of the dark skin people as he gains certain advantages because of being perceived as white. While at times he is disadvantaged like in the scenario where he was almost being robbed by black skin children who perceived he was white but by good luck he spoke their mother tongue.</p>
<p>Racism is also present where he tells us of how when he was eleven years and in grade six he transferred from Maryvale school and went to H.A.Jack where he found out during that black kids were in different classes from their white counterparts. Since his teachers saw him a colored kid they were able to take him to the class where there were whites only. I think this is because the teachers thought that the black kids were not smart. </p>
<p>He also noticed that Soweto the township where his grandmother lived was constructed in a way that it could be easily bombed by the government, meaning it was their target. There were only two roads in and out Soweto.</p>

<p>In school whenever he did a mistake he was sent to the principal who was somehow afraid of beating him hard compared to how he was beating the black skin children. This could because he thought something bad would happen to him when he is beaten hard because of his color. </p>
<p>He also talks about how racism was preset in schools as black skinned children were not taught science, history and civics. They were only taught metrics and agriculture which involves counting potatoes, paving ways, chop wood and till soil since they saw no need of teaching Africans history and science. But the white are the ones who were taught history and science.</p>
<p>The part when he got a brand new bike then him and his cousins were riding it back and forth. As he was riding a cute colored girl came and stopped him and asked for his bike and he gave it to her. He tells how happy he was that a girl had spoken to him that it didn’t come to his mind that his bicycle had been stolen. But by good luck his cousins especially Mlungisi his “protector” who was older than him was able to run after the kids and he found the bicycle.</p>
